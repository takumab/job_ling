Purpose:

This is a website dedicated to providing CSUN Linguistics students with jobs and internships in the amazing field of Linguistics. I know Dr. McClave gets bombarded with job opportunites everyday from potential employers. This is an attempt helping her reroute those request to this site Job Ling. I hope to do my best at representing linguistics and CSUN.
